Open-source CLI agent that autonomously writes, audits, and revises novels — with human review gates that keep you in control.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm i -g @actalk/inkos
```

### Configure

**Option 1: Global config (recommended, one-time setup)**

```bash
inkos config set-global \
  --provider openai \
  --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  --api-key sk-xxx \
  --model gpt-4o
```

Saved to `~/.inkos/.env`, shared by all projects. New projects just work without extra config.

**Option 2: Per-project `.env`**

```bash
inkos init my-novel     # Initialize project
# Edit my-novel/.env
```

```bash
# Required
INKOS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai                        # openai / anthropic
INKOS_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1     # API endpoint (proxy-friendly)
INKOS_LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxx                          # API Key
INKOS_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o                            # Model name

# Optional
# INKOS_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7                       # Temperature
# INKOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=8192                        # Max output tokens
# INKOS_LLM_THINKING_BUDGET=0                      # Anthropic extended thinking budget
```

Project `.env` overrides global config. Skip it if no override needed.

### Write Your First Book

```bash
inkos book create --title "Devouring Emperor" --genre xuanhuan  # Create a book
inkos write next my-book          # Write next chapter (full pipeline: draft → audit → revise)
inkos status                      # Check status
inkos review list my-book         # Review drafts
inkos review approve-all my-book  # Batch approve
inkos export my-book              # Export full book
inkos export my-book --format epub  # Export EPUB (read on phone/Kindle)
```

## Why InkOS?

Writing a novel with AI isn't just "prompt and paste." Long-form fiction breaks down fast: characters forget things, items appear from nowhere, the same adjectives repeat every paragraph, and plot threads silently die. InkOS treats these as engineering problems.

- **Canonical truth files** — track the real state of the world, not what the LLM hallucinates
- **Anti-information-leaking** — characters only know what they've actually witnessed
- **Resource decay** — supplies deplete and items break, no infinite backpacks
- **Vocabulary fatigue detection** — catches overused words before readers do
- **Auto-revision** — fixes math errors and continuity breaks before human review

## How It Works

Each chapter is produced by five agents in sequence:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-pipeline.png" width="800" alt="Pipeline diagram">
</p>

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Radar** | Scans platform trends and reader preferences to inform story direction (pluggable, skippable) |
| **Architect** | Plans chapter structure: outline, scene beats, pacing targets |
| **Writer** | Produces prose from the plan + current world state |
| **Continuity Auditor** | Validates the draft against canonical truth files |
| **Reviser** | Fixes issues found by the auditor — auto-fixes critical problems, flags others for human review |

If the audit fails, the pipeline automatically enters a revise → re-audit loop until all critical issues are resolved.

### Canonical Truth Files

Every book maintains 7 truth files as the single source of truth:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `current_state.md` | World state: character locations, relationships, knowledge, emotional arcs |
| `particle_ledger.md` | Resource accounting: items, money, supplies with quantities and decay tracking |
| `pending_hooks.md` | Open plot threads: foreshadowing planted, promises to readers, unresolved conflicts |
| `chapter_summaries.md` | Per-chapter summaries: characters, key events, state changes, hook dynamics |
| `subplot_board.md` | Subplot progress board: A/B/C line status tracking |
| `emotional_arcs.md` | Emotional arcs: per-character emotion tracking and growth |
| `character_matrix.md` | Character interaction matrix: encounter records, information boundaries |

The Continuity Auditor checks every draft against these files. If a character "remembers" something they never witnessed, or pulls a weapon they lost two chapters ago, the auditor catches it. Legacy books without new truth files are automatically compatible.

</p>

### Writing Rule System

The Writer agent has ~25 universal writing rules (character craft, narrative technique, logical consistency, language constraints, de-AI-ification), applicable to all genres.

On top of that, each genre has dedicated rules (prohibitions, language rules, pacing, audit dimensions), and each book has its own `book_rules.md` (protagonist personality, numerical caps, custom prohibitions) and `story_bible.md` (worldbuilding), auto-generated by the Architect agent.

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Three Usage Modes

InkOS provides three interaction modes, all sharing the same atomic operations:

### 1. Full Pipeline (One Command)

```bash
inkos write next my-book              # Draft → audit → auto-revise, all in one
inkos write next my-book --count 5    # Write 5 chapters in sequence
```

### 2. Atomic Commands (Composable, External Agent Friendly)

```bash
inkos draft my-book --context "Focus on master-disciple conflict" --json
inkos audit my-book 31 --json
inkos revise my-book 31 --json
```

Each command performs a single operation independently. `--json` outputs structured data. Can be called by OpenClaw or other AI agents via `exec`, or used in scripts.

### 3. Natural Language Agent Mode

```bash
inkos agent "Write an urban cultivation novel with a programmer protagonist"
inkos agent "Write the next chapter, focus on master-disciple conflict"
inkos agent "Scan market trends first, then create a new book based on results"
```

13 built-in tools (write_draft, audit_chapter, revise_chapter, scan_market, create_book, get_book_status, read_truth_files, list_books, write_full_pipeline, web_fetch, import_style, import_canon, import_chapters), with the LLM deciding call order via tool-use.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `inkos init [name]` | Initialize project (omit name to init current directory) |
| `inkos book create` | Create a new book (`--genre`, `--platform`, `--chapter-words`, `--target-chapters`, `--brief <file>` for creative brief) |
| `inkos book update [id]` | Update book settings (`--chapter-words`, `--target-chapters`, `--status`) |
| `inkos book list` | List all books |
| `inkos genre list/show/copy/create` | View, copy, or create genres |
| `inkos write next [id]` | Full pipeline: write next chapter (`--words` to override, `--count` for batch, `-q` quiet mode) |
| `inkos write rewrite [id] <n>` | Rewrite chapter N (restores state snapshot, `--force` to skip confirmation, `--words` to override) |
| `inkos draft [id]` | Write draft only (`--words` to override word count, `-q` quiet mode) |
| `inkos audit [id] [n]` | Audit a specific chapter |
| `inkos revise [id] [n]` | Revise a specific chapter |
| `inkos agent <instruction>` | Natural language agent mode |
| `inkos review list [id]` | Review drafts |
| `inkos review approve-all [id]` | Batch approve |
| `inkos status [id]` | Project status |
| `inkos export [id]` | Export book (`--format txt/md/epub`, `--output <path>`, `--approved-only`) |
| `inkos radar scan` | Scan platform trends |
| `inkos config set-global` | Set global LLM config (~/.inkos/.env) |
| `inkos config show-global` | Show global config |
| `inkos config set/show` | View/update project config |
| `inkos config set-model <agent> <model>` | Set model override for a specific agent (`--base-url`, `--provider`, `--api-key-env` for multi-provider routing) |
| `inkos config remove-model <agent>` | Remove agent model override (fall back to default) |
| `inkos config show-models` | Show current model routing |
| `inkos doctor` | Diagnose setup issues (API connectivity test + provider compatibility hints) |
| `inkos detect [id] [n]` | AIGC detection (`--all` for all chapters, `--stats` for statistics) |
| `inkos style analyze <file>` | Analyze reference text to extract style fingerprint |
| `inkos style import <file> [id]` | Import style fingerprint into a book |
| `inkos import canon [id] --from <parent>` | Import parent canon for spinoff writing |
| `inkos import chapters [id] --from <path>` | Import existing chapters for continuation (`--split`, `--resume-from`) |
| `inkos analytics [id]` / `inkos stats [id]` | Book analytics (audit pass rate, top issues, chapter ranking, token usage) |
| `inkos update` | Update to latest version |
| `inkos up / down` | Start/stop daemon (`-q` quiet mode, auto-writes `inkos.log`) |

`[id]` is auto-detected when the project has only one book. All commands support `--json` for structured output. `draft`/`write next` support `--context` for writing guidance and `--words` to override per-chapter word count. `book create` supports `--brief <file>` to pass a creative brief (your brainstorming/worldbuilding doc) — the Architect builds from your ideas instead of generating from scratch.

## Key Features

### State Snapshots + Chapter Rewrite

Every chapter automatically creates a state snapshot. Use `inkos write rewrite <id> <n>` to roll back and regenerate any chapter — world state, resource ledger, and plot hooks all restore to the pre-chapter state.

### Write Lock

File-based locking prevents concurrent writes to the same book.

### Pre-Write Checklist + Post-Write Settlement

The Writer agent outputs a pre-write checklist before writing (context scope, current resources, pending hooks, conflict overview, risk scan), and a settlement table after writing (resource changes, hook changes). The Auditor cross-validates the settlement table against prose content.

### Pluggable Radar

Radar data sources are pluggable via the `RadarSource` interface. Built-in sources for Tomato Novel and Qidian. Custom data sources or skipping radar entirely are both supported.

### Daemon Mode

`inkos up` starts an autonomous background loop that writes chapters on a schedule. The pipeline runs fully unattended for non-critical issues, but pauses for human review when the auditor flags problems it cannot auto-fix. All logs are written to `inkos.log` (JSON Lines format) in the project root. Use `-q` to suppress stderr and keep only file logging.

### Notifications

Telegram, Feishu, WeCom, and Webhook. In daemon mode, get notified on your phone when a chapter is done or an audit fails. Webhook supports HMAC-SHA256 signing and event filtering.

### External Agent Integration

Atomic commands + `--json` output make InkOS callable by OpenClaw and other AI agents. OpenClaw executes `inkos draft`/`audit`/`revise` via `exec`, reads JSON results, and decides next steps.
